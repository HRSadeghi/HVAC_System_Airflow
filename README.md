Revit is a building information modeling (BIM) software developed by Autodesk, used by architects, engineers, and construction professionals. It allows users to design and document building structures in a 3D model-based environment. 

HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems are used to regulate temperature and air quality in buildings. In Revit, HVAC systems are modeled using various elements such as ducts, air terminals, and mechanical equipment.
